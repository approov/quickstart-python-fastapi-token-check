# Approov Token Quickstart

This quickstart is for developers familiar with Python who are looking for a quick intro into how they can add [Approov](https://approov.io) into an existing project. Therefore this will guide you through the necessary steps for adding Approov to an existing Python FastAPI server.

## Why?

To lock down your API server to your mobile app. Please read the brief summary in the [Approov Overview](/OVERVIEW.md#why) at the root of this repo or visit our [website](https://approov.io/product) for more details.

## How it works?

For more background, see the [Approov Overview](/OVERVIEW.md#how-it-works) at the root of this repo.

The main functionality for the Approov token check is in the file [src/approov-protected-server/token-check/hello-server-protected.py](/src/approov-protected-server/token-check/hello-server-protected.py). Take a look at the `verifyApproovToken()` function to see the simple code for the check.

## Requirements

To complete this quickstart you will need both the Python, FastAPI, and the Approov CLI tool installed.

* [Python 3](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)
* [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/#install-fastapi)
* [Approov CLI](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-installation/#approov-tool) - Learn how to use it [here](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-cli-tool-reference/)

## Approov Setup

To use Approov with the Python FastAPI server we need a small amount of configuration. First, Approov needs to know the API domain that will be protected. Second, the Python FastAPI server needs the Approov Base64 encoded secret that will be used to verify the tokens generated by the Approov cloud service.

### Configure API Domain

Approov needs to know the domain name of the API for which it will issue tokens.

Add it with:

```text
approov api -add your.api.domain.com
```

Adding the API domain also configures the [dynamic certificate pinning](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-usage-documentation/#approov-dynamic-pinning) setup, out of the box.

> **NOTE:** By default the pin is extracted from the public key of the leaf certificate served by the domain, as visible to the box issuing the Approov CLI command and the Approov servers.

### Approov Secret

Approov tokens are signed with a symmetric secret. To verify tokens, we need to grab the secret using the [Approov secret command](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-cli-tool-reference/#secret-command) and plug it into the Python FastAPI server environment to check the signatures of the [Approov Tokens](https://www.approov.io/docs/latest/approov-usage-documentation/#approov-tokens) that it processes.

First, enable your Approov `admin` role with:

```bash
eval `approov role admin`
````

For the Windows powershell:

```bash
set APPROOV_ROLE=admin:___YOUR_APPROOV_ACCOUNT_NAME_HERE___
```

Next, retrieve the Approov secret with:

```bash
approov secret -get base64
```

#### Set the Approov Secret

Open the `.env` file and add the Approov secret to the var:

```text
APPROOV_BASE64_SECRET=approov_base64_secret_here
```

## Approov Token Check

To check the Approov token we will use the [jpadilla/pyjwt/](https://github.com/jpadilla/pyjwt/) package, but you are free to use another one of your preference.

First, add to your `requirements.txt` file the JWT dependency:

```bash
PyJWT==1.7.1 # update the version to the latest one
```

Next, you need to install the dependency:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Now, add this code to your project, just before your first API endpoint:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse

# @link https://github.com/jpadilla/pyjwt/
import jwt
import base64

# @link https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv
from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
load_dotenv(find_dotenv(), override=True)
from os import getenv

# Token secret value obtained with the Approov CLI tool:
#  - approov secret -get
approov_base64_secret = getenv('APPROOV_BASE64_SECRET')

if approov_base64_secret == None:
    raise ValueError("Missing the value for environment variable: APPROOV_BASE64_SECRET")

APPROOV_SECRET = base64.b64decode(approov_base64_secret)

app = FastAPI()

# ONLY ADD YOUR MIDDLEWARE BEFORE THIS LINE.
# - FastAPI seems to execute middleware in the reverse we declare it in the
#   code.
# - Approov middleware SHOULD be the first to be executed in the request life
#   cycle.
################################################################################

# @link https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-usage-documentation/#backend-integration
# @IMPORTANT FastAPI seems to execute middleware in the reverse order they
#            appear in the code, therefore this one must come as the LAST of the
#            middleware's.
@app.middleware("http")
async def verifyApproovToken(request: Request, call_next):
    approov_token = request.headers.get("Approov-Token")

    # If we didn't find a token, then reject the request.
    if approov_token == "":
        # You may want to add some logging here.
        # return None
        return JSONResponse({}, status_code = 401)

    try:
        # Decode the Approov token explicitly with the HS256 algorithm to avoid
        # the algorithm None attack.
        approov_token_claims = jwt.decode(approov_token, APPROOV_SECRET, algorithms=['HS256'])
        return await call_next(request)
    except jwt.ExpiredSignatureError as e:
        # You may want to add some logging here.
        return JSONResponse({}, status_code = 401)
    except jwt.InvalidTokenError as e:
        # You may want to add some logging here.
        return JSONResponse({}, status_code = 401)

# @app.get("/")
# async def root():
#     return {"message": "Hello World"}
```

> **NOTE:** When the Approov token validation fails we return a `401` with an empty body, because we don't want to give clues to an attacker about the reason the request failed, and you can go even further by returning a `400`.

Using the middleware approach will ensure that all endpoints in your API will be protected by Approov.

A full working example for a simple Hello World server can be found at [src/approov-protected-server/token-check](/src/approov-protected-server/token-check).

## Test your Approov Integration

The following examples below use cURL, but you can also use the [Postman Collection](/README.md#testing-with-postman) to make the API requests. Just remember that you need to adjust the urls and tokens defined in the collection to match your deployment. Alternatively, the above README also contains instructions for using the preset _dummy_ secret to test your Approov integration.

#### With Valid Approov Tokens

Generate a valid token example from the Approov Cloud service:

```text
approov token -genExample your.api.domain.com
```

Then make the request with the generated token:

```text
curl -i --request GET 'https://your.api.domain.com' \
  --header 'Approov-Token: APPROOV_TOKEN_EXAMPLE_HERE'
```

The request should be accepted. For example:

```text
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

...

{"message": "Hello, World!"}
```

#### With Invalid Approov Tokens

Generate an invalid token example from the Approov Cloud service:

```text
approov token -type invalid -genExample your.api.domain.com
```

Then make the request with the generated token:

```text
curl -i --request GET 'https://your.api.domain.com' \
  --header 'Approov-Token: APPROOV_INVALID_TOKEN_EXAMPLE_HERE'
```

The above request should fail with an Unauthorized error. For example:

```text
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized

...
{}
```
